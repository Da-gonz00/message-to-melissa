            <p><strong>Melissa, my Venom (yes that's my stupid corny nickname for you now lmao). As you know I have some trouble expressing what I want to say with words.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>To be honest I just think it's because I've always had trouble when it came to having feelings for people and I have them for you so it can just be hard at times.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>I am infatuated by you, you're so kind and caring but strong and determined at the same time. You don't let anyone give you shit and I admire that about you.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You're actually pretty funny and patient considering you put up with my stupid remarks. And while we're on the topic of funny, I love your little giggle.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>By the way, the other day when you told me you tried what I told you about with hiding your kicks with the Jab on Jorge, it made me so happy lol I thought to myself "that's my girl".</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Time to say some pretty gay things (even more believe it or not lmao)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>This is random and I don't remember what I said to make you say this but you said "there are other fish in the sea" and I said out loud to myself, "Fuck other fish, I want you"</strong></p>
            <p><strong>I really do get lost in your eyes, you're constantly on my mind, I like the way it feels when you brush your arm on mine, I miss the pressure of your lips on mine and you are the first person I want to tell things to when it happens yet I still blank out haha.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>ALSO I know you didn't want to give me a hickey because of people at Uprising and my family but like to be honest, I want people to know I'm yours.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Anyway the reason I am doing this randomly is because of our conversation about ya know what lmao. You were so understanding but I do have something to say that I didn't when I was with you.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You mentioned something about "when it happens, whether it's with me or someone else ..." MAN FUCK ANYONE ELSE, I want it to be with you and only you, whenever it may be. Obviously, I won't be that good for a while so sorry about that lol</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Anyway yeah, sorry if this is a bit much but I wanted to get it off my chest lmao</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Have fun tomorrow at the movies baby, be safe, good night.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Last thing I promise. Remember the first night I brought you Donut Tyme and you said that you would like to be the type of girl that is like a "damsel" I decided then that I wanted to get stronger for you and wanted to be someone you can rely on and feel safe with, I'm going to be that person for you hermosa. </strong></p>
            <p><small>p.s. this now exists online forever lmao</small></p>
